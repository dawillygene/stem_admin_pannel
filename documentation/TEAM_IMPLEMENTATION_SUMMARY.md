## API Integration Status
The frontend is ready to integrate with the backend API endpoints. According to TEAM_API_FINAL_STATUS.md, the backend APIs are already implemented and tested. The frontend will work seamlessly once the backend is running.

### Expected API Response Format
The implementation expects the following JSON response format as specified:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "team_members": [...],
    "pagination": {...}
  },
  "message": "Success message"
}
```

## Next Steps (Post-Implementation)
1. **Backend Integration Testing** - Test with actual API endpoints
2. **User Acceptance Testing** - Validate with admin users
3. **Performance Optimization** - Add caching if needed
4. **Access Control** - Implement role-based permissions
5. **Analytics Integration** - Add usage tracking if required
