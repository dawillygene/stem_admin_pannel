# Progress Tracker - About Management Eye Icon Fix
**Author:** Elia William Mariki (@dawillygene)
**Date:** July 3, 2025

## Issue Identified
- Eye icon buttons in Overview section were not showing content in modal
- `handleViewContent()` function was being called without passing actual data
- Modal was receiving `null` for item parameter

## Steps Completed ✅
1. **Identified root cause**: Eye icon buttons calling `handleViewContent('section')` without data
2. **Fixed Background section**: Updated to pass `background` data as second parameter
3. **Fixed Benefits section**: Updated to pass `benefits` array as second parameter  
4. **Fixed Justification section**: Updated to pass `justification` data as second parameter
5. **Fixed Objectives section**: Updated to pass `objectives` data as second parameter
6. **Verified AboutContentModal**: Confirmed modal components properly handle data display
7. **Updated .gitignore**: Added test files and documentation exclusions
8. **Created progress tracking**: This file for requirement tracking

## Code Changes Made
- Modified 4 eye icon button handlers in AboutManagement.jsx Overview section
- Each now passes the corresponding data section to `handleViewContent()`
- Modal now receives proper data and displays content correctly

## Current Status
- ✅ All Overview section eye icons now functional
- ✅ Modal displays proper content for each section
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✅ Ready for user testing

## Fix Eye Icon Functionality in Benefits and Objectives Tabs (July 3, 2025)
**Author:** Elia William Mariki (@dawillygene)

**Issue:** Eye icons in Benefits and Objectives tabs were not working when viewing individual items

**Root Cause:** 
- Modal components expected arrays but individual items were passed as single objects
- `BenefitsContent` expected array but received single benefit object
- `ObjectivesContent` expected full objectives structure but received single objective

**Solution:**
- Enhanced `AboutContentModal` to detect single vs multiple items
- Created `SingleBenefitContent` component for individual benefit viewing
- Created `SingleObjectiveContent` component for individual objective viewing
- Updated modal title logic to show specific item names

**New Features:**
- **Individual Benefit View:** Beautiful gradient card with status, order, and icon details
- **Individual Objective View:** Blue-themed card with status, order, and helpful note
- **Dynamic Titles:** Modal titles now show "Benefit: [Name]" or "Objective: [Name]"
- **Enhanced UI:** Larger displays with better visual hierarchy for single items

**Code Changes:**
- Updated `renderContent()` logic to detect item types
- Added `SingleBenefitContent` component with green gradient theme
- Added `SingleObjectiveContent` component with blue gradient theme
- Enhanced `getSectionTitle()` for dynamic titles
